                    p You may build a website using the template in any way you like. You may not resell or redistribute templates (like we do); claim intellectual or exclusive ownership to any of our products, modified or unmodified. All products are property of content providing companies and individuals. You are also not allowed to make more than one project using the same template (you have to purchase the same template once more in order to make another project with the same design).

                    p Non-exclusive purchase means that other people can buy the template you have chosen some time later. Exclusive or unique purchase guarantees that you are the last person to buy this template. After an exclusive purchase occurs the template is being permanently removed from the sales directory and will never be available to other customers again. Only you and people who bought the template before you will own it.
